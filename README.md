# BBCP

Despite the increase in the efficiency of energy consumption in information and communication technology, software execution
and its constraints are responsible for how energy is consumed in hardware hosts. Consequently, researchers have promoted the
development of sustainable software with new development methods and tools to lessen its hardware demands. However, the
approaches developed so far lack cohesiveness along the stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and exist outside
of a holistic method for Green Software Development (GSD). In addition, there is a severe lack of approaches that target the
analysis and design stages of the SDLC, leaving software architects and designers unsupported. We introduce here our
Behavior-Based Consumption Profiles (BBCP) external Domain-Specific Language (DSL), aimed at assisting software architects
and designers in modeling the behavior of software. The models generated with our external DSL contain multiple sets of properties
that characterize features of the softwareâ€™s behavior. In contrast to other modeling languages, our BBCP emphasizes how time and
probability are involved in software execution and its evolution over time, helping its users to gather an expectation of software
usage and hardware consumption from the initial stages of software development.
